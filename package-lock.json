JavaScript Practice Programs

This repository contains three simple JavaScript programs written for practice. Each program demonstrates the use of const, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations.

1. Student Grade Generator

Description:
A program that takes student marks (between 0â€“100) and outputs the correct grade.

Grading Criteria:

A: > 79

B: 60â€“79

C: 50â€“59

D: 40â€“49

E: less than 40

Example:

const marks = 90;
// Output: Grade: A

2. Second challengr question....how to solve

Description:
A program that takes as input the speed of a car and calculates demerit points.

Rules:

If speed < 70 â†’ print "Ok".

If speed > 70 â†’ 1 demerit point for every 5 km/s above 70.

If points > 12 â†’ print "License suspended".

Example:

const speed = 80;
// Output: Points: 2

3. third challenge....how to calculate net salary

Description:
A program that calculates an individualâ€™s Net Salary by using inputs of basic salary and benefits.

Calculations include:

Gross Salary

PAYE (Tax) based on KRA tax bands

NSSF deductions (Tier I & Tier II)

SHIF deduction (2.75% of gross salary)

Net Salary

Example:

const basicSalary = 50000;
const benefits = 10000;

// Output:
// Gross Salary: 60000
// PAYE (Tax): ...
// NSSF: ...
// SHIF: ...
// Net Salary: ...

How to Run

Save each program in its own file:

marks.js

speed.js

salary.js

Run the programs using Node.js:

node marks.js
node speed.js
node salary.js


Or paste the code into the browser console (F12 â†’ Console).

ðŸ‘‰ Do you also want me to prepare the exact final versions of marks.js, speed.js, and salary.js so you can just copy-paste them into your repo along with this README.md?
